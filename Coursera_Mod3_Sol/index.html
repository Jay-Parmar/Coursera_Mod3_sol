            <div class="content">
                Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them in
                comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures around
                the world, and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes.
                
                Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, and boiling, among many
                others, depending on its purpose. Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become a staple of
                fast food. Chicken is sometimes cited as being more healthful than red meat, with lower concentrations of cholesterol
                and saturated fat.[2]
                
                The poultry farming industry that accounts for chicken production takes on a range of forms across different parts of
                the world. In developed countries, chickens are typically subject to intensive farming methods, while less-developed
                areas raise chickens using more traditional farming techniques. The United Nations estimates there to be 19 billion
                chickens on Earth today, making them outnumber humans more than two to one.[3]

                Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, pronounced [sɯɕiꜜ] or [sɯꜜɕi]) is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice (鮨飯, sushi-meshi),
                usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients (ネタ, neta), such as seafood, often raw, and
                vegetables. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred
                to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).[1]
                
                Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice.
                It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types
                of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled
                daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.
                
                Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly sliced raw fish, or
                occasionally meat, and an optional serving of rice.[2]

            </div>
            <div class="content">
                Vegetarianism is the practice of abstaining from the consumption of meat (red meat, poultry, seafood, and the flesh of
                any other animal), and may also include abstention from by-products of animal slaughter.[1][2]
                
                Vegetarianism may be adopted for various reasons. Many people object to eating meat out of respect for sentient life.
                Such ethical motivations have been codified under various religious beliefs, as well as animal rights advocacy. Other
                motivations for vegetarianism are health-related, political, environmental, cultural, aesthetic, economic, or personal
                preference. There are variations of the diet as well: an ovo-lacto vegetarian diet includes both eggs and dairy
                products, an ovo-vegetarian diet includes eggs but not dairy products, and a lacto-vegetarian diet includes dairy
                products but not eggs. A vegan diet excludes all animal products, including eggs and dairy. Avoidance of animal products
                may require dietary supplements to prevent deficiencies such as vitamin B12 deficiency, which leads to pernicious
                anemia.[3][4] Psychologically, preference for vegetarian foods can be impacted by one's own socio-economic status and
                evolutionary factors.[5][6][7]
                
                Packaged and processed foods, such as cakes, cookies, candies, chocolate, yogurt, and marshmallows, often contain
                unfamiliar animal ingredients, and so may be a special concern for vegetarians due to the likelihood of such
                additives.[2][8] Feelings among vegetarians may vary concerning these ingredients. Some vegetarians scrutinize product
                labels for animal-derived ingredients[8] while others do not object to consuming cheese made with animal-derived rennet
                or are unaware of its presence.[2][2][9][10]
                
                Semi-vegetarian diets consist largely of vegetarian foods but may inclu
